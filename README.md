# Wine-Quality
determine quality of wine by its chemical makeup using python

Using ML, the question of whether we can determine the quality of wine based on a certain chemical makeup is answered.

## Description of the data set

Through the UCI ML Repository,* we selected a dataset detailing red vinho (wine) samples from the north of Portugal.

The datasets contained 12 attributes based on physicochemical tests ranging from:

fixed acidity
volatile acidity
citric acid
residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
Sulphates
alcohol level
quality


## Results

We applied classification to answer how several variables are related --  specifically how the 11 categorized features of our data set impacts quality of wine.

Comparing the two models, we have found that they are more or less equally accurate in predicting new data although we would consider Logistic Regression as the better model due to the higher AOC score it produces.
